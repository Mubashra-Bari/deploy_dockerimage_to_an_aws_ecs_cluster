# Deploy a docker image to an AWS ECS cluster using Terraform
This code sets up an ECS cluster with Fargate capacity providers and uses a pre-built module to create an ECS Fargate service within the cluster. The service is configured with a specific Docker image, resource requirements, networking settings, and health checks. The setup is designed for a non-load-balanced scenario.
